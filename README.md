# pvp-mode
A Minecraft mod that allows players to enable/disable PvP individually.

ATTENTION: The mod is in BETA, and there are bugs that are being worked on.

REQUIREMENTS:
Minecraft 1.7.10
Forge 1.7.10-10.13.4.1614 (possibly an earlier version will work)

INSTALLATION:
Click the JAR file in the file list above, then click Download.
Place the JAR file in the server mods folder.

USAGE:
/pvp toggles the command sender's PvP restriction status.
/pvp \<playername> toggles the player's PvP restriction status. Only an admin can perform this command.

Note: there is a cooldown on the /pvp command.

/pvplist displays a list of all players who are online and whether PvP is enabled or disabled for them.
