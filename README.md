# pvp-mode
A Minecraft mod that allows players to enable/disable PvP for only themselves.

Get the JAR file by clicking it in the file list above, then the Download button.
All you have to do is put the JAR file into your mods folder on your Forge 1.7.10 server.
This mod was built on Forge 1.7.10-10.13.4.1614 so I can't guarantee it works on other Forge builds.
I CAN guarantee that it won't work on a version other than 1.7.10. Yes, I'm a dinosaur and proud of it.

All players have access to the /pvp on and /pvp off commands.
If they activate these, they can neither be attacked or attack another player.
However, wolves and other player-bound NPCs will still be able to attack another player.
Admins also have access to the /pvp <on:off> [playername] command.
