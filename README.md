# pvp-mode
A Minecraft mod that allows players to enable/disable PvP for only themselves.

ATTENTION: 1.2.0 is in BETA, so don't expect it to work properly yet.

REQUIREMENTS:
Minecraft 1.7.10
Forge 1.7.10-10.13.4.1614 (possibly an earlier version will work)

INSTALLATION:
Click the JAR file in the file list above, then click Download.
Place the JAR file in the server mods folder.

USAGE:
This mod adds one simple command: "/pvp <on:off> [playername]"
All players can enable/disable PvP for themselves, but only an admin can change another player's PvP settings.
