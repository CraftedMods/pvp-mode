CHANGELOG:

1.6.0-BETA

The cooldown and warmup are now configurable in a configuration file.
Player radar behaviour is now configurable as well.

1.5.0-BETA

The /pvplist command will now display player distances to the nearest four chunks
for players who have PvP enabled. There is now a cooldown as well as a warmup on the /pvp
command; the warmup is now 15 seconds rather than five.

1.4.1-BETA

Players in creative mode or who have fly ability have PvP disabled automatically.

1.4.0-BETA

Added a 5-second cooldown on the /pvp command.
Removed on/off functionality; the command is now simply a toggle.

Temporarily removed the config file option preparatory to LOTR mod testing.

Added a patch that disables tamed wolves from attacking another player.

1.1.0

Added a config option that disables PvE along with PvP if the command is entered.
Fixed a bug with permission levels.

1.0.0

Added "/pvp <on:off> [playername]" command.
Players cannot hit or shoot each other if either has PvP disabled.
Admins can enable/disable PvP for other players, but regular players can only do it on themselves.
